"Just curious, I was wondering whether or not you might be curious in attending a Mochi Festival next week after finals?{a} We plan on having a small little competition for SF during the festival as well."
"You should definitely consider it,{a} Who knows?{a} You might somehow win the tournmanent! The entrance fee is only a box of Mochi,{a} with the prize being a year supply of it in return!"

narrator "<color=#ccc><i>I did toss today's game so as not to hurt his feeling. A small tournament would be a great chance to regain my pride as a SF competitor.{a} Not to mention that a year supply of mochi would be one heck of a prize.</i></color>"
"Yeah that sounds like a great idea, thanks. I guess I’ll see you next week!"

Kuma "Indeed, it’s been a pleasure Ushi!{a} Good luck with your finals!"
